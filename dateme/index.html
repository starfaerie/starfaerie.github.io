                                        <p>
                                            I have nearly infinite patience for children and believe they are fully rational and creative humans.
                                            I was home educated for my entire life, which is just another way of saying that my inner child is still very much alive.
                                            I have a lifelong addiction to learning, and solving problems with others is my greatest joy.
                                            I am looking for a partner who emobodies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei" class="inline-link">wuwei</a>,
                                            will inspire my own creativity, and with whom I can collaboratively solve problems.
                                            My natural proclivity in groups is to gravitate to mediation and leadership roles.
                                            Friends and family have called me a 'peace-maker,' a 'whistle-blower,' 'the food faerie,' and <a href="https://twitter.com/IDJoe4Congress/status/1439289332829806592" class="inline-link">'some local documentarian.'</a>
                                            People are innately interesting to me and I spend a not-insignificant portion of my time preserving other's knowledge.

                            <h5><i>(What I'm looking for)</i></h5>
                        </header>
                        <p><strong class="big">Gender/Aesthetics</strong>: You are cis and feminine. You strongly express
                            aesthetic femininity and identify with your femaleness.
                            Your personality/disposition may or may not be feminine,
                            but if someone at random were asked to describe your aesthetic
                            they would probably use words like 'feminine', 'artsy', or 'soft' to describe your style.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Emotional fluency</strong>:
                            You know yourself. You know what you're feeling most of the time and
                            how to identify your needs. You know who you are, what
                            you want, and you are skilled in communicating that to others.</p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Integrity</strong>: You have values you're willing to stand up for, even when it comes at a
                            social cost. You care more about what's true and good than what others think about you.
                            Your actions are in harmony with your words and your moral character is apparent to all
                            who know you.</p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Intellectualism</strong>: You are in love with learning and have a deep curiosity
                            that can never be satisfied. Persistent learning is part of your lifestyle, and you thrive on deep
                            conversations with those around you. You don't shy away from using precise language when neccesary
                            to express yourself or explore ideas. e.g. If you can explain Bayes rule or the psychoactive mechanisms of specific micromolecules to
                            a fifth grader, we will probably get along.</p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Sexuality</strong>: You would describe your approach to sex as 'playful.'
                            You know what you want, but you find just as much pleasure in the process of getting to the destination
                            as you do in the arrival. You enjoy having a partner who is both publicly affectionate and just as much of a
                            tease as you are.
                            You enjoy trading roles in the relationship spontaneously and take pleasure in participating in a sexual
                            dance of spontaneous
                            giving/receieving/directing/yielding that never ends.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Disposition</strong>: You are bubbly, expressive, effervescent.
                            You have an enthusiasm for life and have a high energy, type-A personality.
                            When you see something you want, you don't wait for permission to go and get it.
                            Nothing can stop you from getting what you want from the world.
                            You exude a magnetic warmth and friendliness. Strangers feel comfortable asking you for help.
                            If Hansel and Gretel met you in the woods they would instinctively trust you to help them find their way back home.
                            You are difficult to offend and not afraid to make fun of yourself.
                            Your friends would describe you as: “unique, smart, artsy, kind, affectionate.”
                            You have an underlying sense of happiness or 'okayness' and acceptance that exists as a
                            constant background to your other emotions and experiences. You have a

                        <p><strong class="big">Optimism/Unconditional Love</strong>: I have an abundance mindset and natural proclivity for optimism.
                            I can't help but believe that a world of abundance (both material and emotional) for all is
                            both possible and realistic.
                            I do not believe suffering is inevitable, instead I believe that
                            we all deserve unconditional love from others and ourselves. I strive to eliminate coercion in all forms (including self-coercion) whenever possible.
                            I think that trying to motivate and control people (including ourselves) with
                            praise, rewards, guilt, shame, and punishments is a form of conditional love that
                            crushes the naturally creative spirit within us.
                            I believe people are good and well intentioned, that problems have solutions,
                            and that all people are fallible, including and especially myself.
                            I believe that I am the author of my own destiny and that the responsibility for my own experience in the world begins and ends with myself.
                            I live my life in a constant state of awe and celebration of the intrinsic value of life and the limitless goodness
                            in the world manifested in others by treating people (including myself, and children!) with compassion, humility, and unconditional love.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">My Personality</strong>: My sister says my humor is 'too deadpan.'
                            I like irony, and strongly dislike sarcasm.
                            In a crisis I immediately assume a leadership role and will be the first to act and the last to panic.
                            It takes a <em>lot</em> to emotionally unsettle me. I don't engage in gossip. I have above average
                            social confidence and well below average epistemic confidence.
                            I enjoy spending time in shared silence with friends, but also love having week-long conversations during adventures.
                            I say no to most things and live a more minimalistic lifestyle than most so that I have
                            more resources available for the people I love.
                            I'm <em>almost always</em> humming, singing, or dancing as I go about my life.
                            I am a lifelong infovore and spend most of my time learning or doing. That habit has enabled me to live many lives including but not limited to:

                            I don't believe in restricting 'allowable behaviors' outside of a relationship.
                            That social script feels coercive and patronizing to me.
                            If hooking up with your best friend brings you joy, by all means, pursue your joy.
                            Some people think this makes me polyamorous rather than monogamous so I thought it worth including.
                            Personally I've never yet experienced sexual desire outside of a pre-existing relationship.
                            I would like to be involved in a mutually committed relationship with a shared understanding
                            that we are building a life together for the long-term, free from coercion. I have a

                        <p><strong class="big">Gender/Aesthetics</strong>: Some people in my life refer to me using 'she/her' pronouns,
                            and I don't see what the big deal about it is but enough people have asked me about it that it felt neccesary to include here.
                            Please refer to me <em>however feels right to you</em> as you get to know me.
                            I was assigned male at birth and don't plan on doing anything to change my biological sex.
                            I don't identify as either transsexual or transgender but I do regularly dress in a more feminine way
                            than the average male and don't correct people who categorize me in any particular way to fit their own worldview.
                            I see identity categories as tools of social coercion so I abstain from self-identity whenever possible.
                            If you're looking for someone with a <em>strictly</em> masculine aesthetic you won't find them here.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">My Lifestyle</strong>:
                            I spend most of my time reading or writing. I reliably am awake by 6am to start reading
                            or execute on any available trades and arbitrages I find in public markets every morning.
                            Weekdays I tend to be programming or otherwise occupied running a motion capture studio in LA from 8am-4pm,
                            but I have broad discretion over my schedule and always make time for adventures.
                            I go dancing (West Coast Swing) with friends once a week in Santa Monica.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Family of Origin</strong>: I'm the eldest of four siblings and I love and get along
                            with my three younger sisters incredibly well, though they have radically different values and lifestyles than myself so we don't talk often.
                            My parents raised me into an Evangelical Christian cult that they were not happy I left,
                            though these days we get along fine and still talk regularly.
                            Because of the way I grew up I have almost no frame of reference for popular culture,
                            so celebrity names and movie quotes will go over my head 95% of the time.
                            One of the more positive things to come of it though is that I've read almost the entirety of the Western canon
                            so I <em>will</em> get your philosophy and history references.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">My Ideal Family</strong>: If children were part of the picture I wouldn't want my
                            children to be forced to do anything against their will.
                            I'd like to extend as much authority to them about their lives as possible, including their education, diets, and lifestyles.
                            People are not empty buckets that you can pour knowledge and values into and I believe in treating children with the same respect as adults.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">On Animals</strong>: I haven't participated in the killing or eating of animals for most of my life because
                            knowingly contributing directly to the end of someone else's life,
                            or treating another's life as a mere resource or utility for my own ends would weigh heavy on my heart.
                            I went fishing once with my opa when I was young and saw an animal die for the first time. That was enough for me to realize
                            I don't see the <em>Hominidae</em> and other animal life as morally distinct to the same degree that others around me appear to.
                            If you share this intuition, that's an extra-extra bonus.
