                                                only that I get some kind of priority consideration.
                                                I like the idea of dedicating to a relationship for the long-term and building a life

                                        <p>You know that person who always sat at the front of the class, took extensive
                                            notes,
                                            was persistently a week or two ahead in the homework,
                                            and also somehow still had time to play every sport under the sun?
                                            That was probably me. Once I decide to do something I don’t
                                            commit halfway. I have infinite patience for children but incredibly little for
                                            adults who make commitments and don’t honor them.
                                            One year I set the goal of reading 100 books and I ended the year at 153.
                                            I gravitate to mediation and leadership roles.
                                            Friends and family have called me a 'peace-maker', a 'whistle-blower', or 'the food faerie.'

                        <h4>About You</h4>
                        <p>(You don’t have to match <em>all</em> of these descriptions. But the more that resonate with you, the
                            better.)
                        </p>
                        <p>If you find yourself staring at your reflection as you read this, we should at least be friends.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Gender</strong>: You are feminine. You strongly express <em>either</em>
                            aesthetic femininity or identify with femaleness (both is an <em>extra</em> plus).
                            Your personality/disposition may or may not be feminine,
                            but if someone at random were asked to describe your aesthetic
                            they would probably use the words 'feminine', 'artsy', or 'soft' to describe your appearance.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Emotional fluency</strong>: You’ve probably read a lot of books on communicating,
                            parenting, “therapy books”, you regularly do some introspection or self-therapy techniques, meditation, etc.
                            You know yourself. You know what you’re feeling most of the time and
                            how to identify your needs. You know who you are, what
                            you want, and you are skilled in communicating that to others.</p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Fiscal Responsibility</strong>: You know and have internalized the opportunity cost
                            of your time and have an idea of your present financial situation. You understand the value of
                            under-consumption and you use the power of compounding interest to your benefit.</p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Integrity</strong>: You have values you’re willing to stand up for, even if comes at a
                            social cost.
                            Your actions are in harmony with your words and your moral character is apparent to all
                            who know you.</p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Intellectualism</strong>: You are in love with learning and have a deep curiosity
                            that can never be satisfied. Persistent learning is part of your lifestyle, and you thrive on deep
                            conversations with those around you. You don’t shy away from using precise language when neccesary
                            to express yourself or explore ideas. If you can explain Bayes rule to
                            a fifth grader, we will probably get along.</p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Sexuality</strong>: You would describe your approach to sex as ‘playful.’
                            You know what you want, but you find just as much pleasure in the process of getting to the destination
                            as you do in the arrival. You enjoy having a partner who is both publicly affectionate and just as much of a
                            tease as you are.
                            You enjoy trading roles in the relationship spontaneously and take pleasure in participating in a sexual
                            dance of spontaneous
                            giving/receieving/directing/yielding that never ends.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Disposition</strong>: You are bubbly, expressive, effervescent.
                            You have an enthusiasm for life and have a high energy, type-A personality.
                            When you see something you want, you don't wait for permission to go and get it.
                            You exude a magnetic warmth and friendliness.
                            If Hansel and Gretel met you in the woods they would trust you to help them find their way back home.
                            You are difficult to offend and not afraid to make fun of yourself.
                            Your friends would describe you as: “unique, artsy, unusual, kind, affectionate.”
                            You have an underlying sense of ‘okayness’ and acceptance that exists as a
                            constant background to your other emotions and experiences. You have a

                        <p><strong class="big">Optimism/Unconditional Love</strong>: I believe that a world of abundance is
                            not only possible but realistic and that we can attain it without using guilt, social shaming,
                            or other means of negative reinforcement. I also think that trying to motivate people with cheap
                            praise, rewards, or positive reinforcement
                            <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/blogs/criticizing-common-criticisms-praise/" class="inline-link">crushes

                            within us. Basically I don’t like carrots or sticks, especially guilt and praise.
                            People are <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/behavior/" class="inline-link">more complex than the
                                Behaviorists give us credit for</a>
                            and their methods of control and influence are patronizing and dehumanizing and
                            should be relegated to the dustbin of history. If you try to control other people
                            through micro-punishments like silence or emotional coldness or if you believe
                            hitting children is ever appropriate I don’t want to talk to you. On the other hand if you
                            believe in celebrating the intrinsic value of life and you take joy in treating others with
                            compassion, humility, and forgiveness we will be fast friends.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong class="big">Veganism</strong>: I’ve been a vegan for more than half my life because I wouldn’t be
                            able to live with myself if I knowingly contributed directly to the end of someone else’s life.
                            I watched a fish die once and that was enough for me to realize
                            I don’t see the <em>Hominidae</em> and other animal life as morally distinct.
                            However, I recognize that this is not a wildly popular ethical position so if you don't share it that's
                            fine.

                            shifts from low deference to high deference depending on the number of people in the room.
                            In a crisis I immediately assume a leadership role and will be the first to act and the last to panic.
                            It takes a <em>lot</em> to emotionally unsettle me. I don’t engage in gossip. I have above average
                            self-confidence.
                            I enjoy spending time in shared silence with friends, but also love having week-long conversations in the
                            mountains.
                            I live a more minimalistic lifestyle than most so that I have more resources available to give to others.
                            I’m <em>almost always</em> humming, singing, or dancing as I go about my life.
                            I like ideas and will often 'try on' ideas that I don't neccesarily believe in order to
                            nudge myself and others towards better reasoning habits (I think the Rationalist community is on to
                            something).

                            in my relationships so I don’t insist on restricting behavior outside of the relationship as
                            long as you're not trying to hide it. You hooking up with your best friend after 3 years of otherwise
                            unexpressed sexual tension is something to celebrate, not receive a guilt trip for.
                            Personally though I've never experienced sexual desire outside of a pre-existing relationship,
                            so unless your friends are walking angels it’s unlikely that I’ll meet someone
                            I find sexually intriguing enough to bother pursuing. I would like to be involved in a
                            mutually committed relationship with a shared understanding that we are building a life together
                            for the long-term. I have a

                        <p><strong class="big">Gender</strong>: Once upon a time I had an exploratory <em>gender adventure</em>.
                            Some people in my life refer to me using ‘she/her’ pronouns but please refer to me
                            however feels right to you as you get to know me.
                            I was assigned male at birth and don’t plan on doing anything to change my sex.
                            I don’t identify as transsexual or transgender but I do regulary dress in a more feminine way than the

                            and will often use the women’s restroom because men often have aggressive reactions to seeing someone
                            wearing a skirt and stockings
                            in the men's restroom.
                            If you’re looking for someone with <em>strictly</em> masculine energy you won’t find them here.

                            because I truly do think that politics are the

                            but if politics is a deal-breaker for you in a relationship then I would rather know that early.
                            Broadly speaking it would not be inaccurate to call me a libertarian and a pacifist.
                            Basically I think the <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/LtrLbrty/bryTSO.html"
                                class="inline-link">spontaneous order</a>
                            of markets are a thing of beauty and are infinitely preferable to having authorities decide
                            which human needs are deserving of being met and which aren’t.
                            I would prefer to live in a world where more disputes are resolved without threats of putting people in
                            cages,
                            social ostracism, or violence. My first and primary political commitment is to peace,
                            and I value markets for their ability to provide for people's diverse and emergent needs.

                            with my 3 younger sisters incredibly well, though they have radically different values than I do.
                            My parents raised me in an evangelical homeschooling cult that they were not happy I left,
                            though these days my dad is much closer to a liberal Presbyterian and we get along fine.
                            My mom still struggles to accept the person I am since leaving.
                            She comes from an oil family in Oklahoma and my dad was raised on a homestead in northern Idaho.
                            They met in college and after I was born they serially moved around the northwest every 2
                            years before eventually moving to Germany where I gained fluency in Deutsch.

                            children
                            to be forced to attend a private/public/charter school against their will.
                            I’d like to extend as much authority to them about their lives as possible, including their education.
                            Ideally I’d like to find a partner that would be willing to share in the role of homeschooling children
                            unless/until they expressed a desire to receive a more formal education.
                            I’d also ideally like to have friends or Chosen Family that live relatively close
                            by that could be a significant long-term presence in their lives.
